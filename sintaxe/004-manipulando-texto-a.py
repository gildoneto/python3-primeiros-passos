# Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
# Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
# when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
# It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
# remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
# sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
# Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
